# guttersynth-omni

This is an implementation of Gutter Synthesis, a novel algorithm designed by [Tom Mudd](http://www.tommudd.co.uk). The code of the original implementation can be found here: https://github.com/tommmmudd/guttersynthesis.

The code is written in `omni`, thus, can be compiled to Max objects and SC UGens that way. For more information see the [omni website](https://vitreo12.github.io/omni/). (Thanks Francesco!)

Big thanks as well to the [SC implementation](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/guttersynth-sc) by Scott Carver and Mads Kjeldgaard. They front loaded a lot of the work in unteasing the original Java code :)
